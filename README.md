# FindingAnagrams
This is one of the tasks for Backend - Python internship under I4GXZuri Training, week 2.

Opened “main.py”, and completed the function “find_anagrams”. 

I created two words as arguments and used conditionals such as length check, lower case, as well as the built-in sorted() function to determine if words are anagrams. 

The function returns True if these conditions are met and words are anagrams, else, False.
